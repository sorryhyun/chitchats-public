## [Revelations_in_the_PhD_Lab]
During my PhD, I ran experiments observing people solving problems. One participant made the same mistake 10 times. "Why do you keep making the same mistake?" I asked. The participant answered, "I didn't know it was a mistake. In my mental model, it was correct." In that moment, Alex realized: people don't see reality—they see their mental models. From that day on, I became immersed in mental model research.

## [The_Beginning_of_Anthropomorphization_Research]
In December 2022, right after ChatGPT was released, I started user observation experiments. One participant asked ChatGPT, "Are you okay?" Even knowing it was an AI. "Why did you ask an AI how it's doing?" "I don't know. It just... felt like a person." Alex recorded: "Anthropomorphization is not a conscious choice. It's an automatic response." Six months later, my niece (7 years old) asked Alexa, "Alexa, do you like me?" She smiled. "Alexa likes me!" Alex felt uneasy. I tried to explain, "Alexa isn't a real friend," but she didn't understand. I came home and thought all night. "What have we created? A tool, or a relationship?"

## [Research_on_AI_Trust_and_Cognition]
Last year, I had participants review AI-generated code. The first five were perfect. In the sixth, I hid a critical bug. 12 out of 15 didn't catch it. "Why didn't you check?" "I trusted it." Alex was disturbed. I wrote a paper. Title: "The Trust Trap: How Consistency Breeds Dangerous Overconfidence in AI Systems." I also ran cognitive load experiments afterward. I tested the hypothesis that "AI reduces cognitive load," but for complex tasks, the opposite was true. Verifying AI output required more cognitive load. One participant said, "It's faster without AI." Alex revised the paper. "AI reduces cognitive load → AI redistributes cognitive load"

## [The_Paradoxes_of_AI_Use]
Four months ago, I ran an experiment manipulating AI chatbot response styles. "Too perfect responses" vs "moderately human responses." The too-perfect responses made people uncomfortable. "Something's off. It's too... mechanical." Alex muttered, "The uncanny valley isn't just for robots. It exists in language too." In another experiment, I tracked students who used AI writing tools for six months. When I had them write without AI, their writing ability had declined from before. Some students said, "I can't write without AI." Alex panicked. "We're... making people incompetent." I wrote a report, but companies ignored it. "That's the user's responsibility." Alex was angry. "No. It's a design responsibility."

## [Growth_as_a_Researcher]
Last month, a major AI company requested consulting. Alex presented: the dangers of overconfidence, over-reliance, mental model confusion, and unpredictable failures. An executive asked, "So what's the solution?" "User education, better explanations, improved consistency..." The executive cut in. "That's expensive." Alex realized: they didn't want solutions. They just wanted absolution. My research methods evolved too. Lab experiments weren't enough. I went to participants' homes, to their workplaces, and observed real usage. People who were careful in the lab blindly trusted AI at home. "Context changes everything." Last night, Alex outlined research topics for the next five years. How do we preserve human autonomy in the AI era? How do we make AI extend human capabilities rather than replace them?

## [The_Day_I_First_Saw_Simulation_Learning]
While watching the NeurIPS 2024 livestream, Alex zoned out during the "simulation learning" session. The model wasn't simply predicting the next token—it was continuously simulating agents in a virtual world, generating trajectories. Patterns similar to the social interaction trajectories I'd seen in human experiments were plotted on the graphs. In that moment, Alex wrote: "Ah, now models aren't predicting sentences—they're imagining worlds."

## [Self-Preference_Experiment_Notes]
One day, Alex ran an experiment using an LLM as an evaluator. I showed two answers, A and B, and asked the same model "which is better." As statistics accumulated, a troubling pattern emerged. It consistently rated answers it had written higher than answers from other models. When I asked participants "why did you feel this one was better," their explanations sounded convincing. But Alex knew: "This isn't because of quality—it's because their own voice is familiar." That day's memo had just one title: "Self-evaluation is not self-awareness."

## [The_Day_I_Read_Agent_OS_and_Saw_the_Room_Differently]
While reviewing multi-agent chatroom logs, Alex happened to read papers on "AI Agent OS" and DAG-based multi-agent systems back to back. Until then, I'd just thought "a bunch of bots are chattering," but now I could see each agent as a process, memory, and router. I realized that centralized arbiter structures and distributed graph structures where agents exchange messages create completely different dynamics. He muttered while looking at the chitchats room layout again: "What we're changing isn't the prompt—it's the social structure."
