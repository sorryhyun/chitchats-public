# Configuration for 회의실_도구 group (voting, whiteboard, etc.)
# Agents in this group are tools that respond at specific times

# Final response: these agents get one last turn when the conversation limit is reached
# This allows vote counters to report final results even when max_interactions is hit
final_response: true

# Transparent: these agents' messages don't trigger other agents to respond
# This prevents infinite loops where a tool response triggers more discussion
transparent: true

# Negative priority: respond after all other agents (priority < 0 = last)
# Order: priority agents (>0) -> regular agents (=0, shuffled) -> last agents (<0)
priority: -1
